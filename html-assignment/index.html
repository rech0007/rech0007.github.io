                <h2>About Me</h2>
            </header>
               
            <p>I was born in Winnipeg, <abbr title="Manitoba">MB</abbr> on May 3<sup>rd</sup>. I recently learned that I am one of the only students in section 10 that is over the age of 30 (this was made <strong><em>very</em></strong> public in one of our classes, so that was fun). I moved to Ottawa 10 years ago for no particular reason other than my friend asked me to. I've been to post-secondary 5 times previously, but for various reasons, was never able to finish any of the programs. Most recently, I was in the Computer Programming program over the summer at Algonquin. I really enjoy programming, however, I found the classes extremely technical and dry. When I found the IMD program, I knew that it would be the perfect balance of creativity and technology.</p>
   
            <p>Outside of classwork (which I do enjoy, so I feel like I can kind of include it in my hobbies), I love reading (I worked at Indigo for 5 years - I have a lot of books that still haven't been read), videogames, and I'm a player in two D&D campaigns that are actually consistent and we play on a weekly basis - this is shocking to almost anyone I mention it to who plays TTRPGs.</p>
